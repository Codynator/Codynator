## Hello!
I'm currently a student who's currently focusing on Python and C++. I also have exprience with JavaScript, PHP and SQL.  
My main operating system is Linux (Kubuntu) so my programs sometimes don't support Windows. 

**My main interests are:**
- backend (Django, Apache Server, MariaDB);
- desktop applications (Python and C++);
- embedded programming (Arduino);
- Linux environment.
